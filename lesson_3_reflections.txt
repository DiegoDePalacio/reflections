When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to keep my changes outside of my local computer in order to recover them in another computer or to collaborate with more developers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because I want to keep working on some files that maybe would have conflicts with the ones on the remote.
